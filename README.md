## Setup

The bot requires a discord Oauth token which is stored in a file called `.env` in the program directory, this file is not included in this repo and must be setup for the bot to work. The contents of the file should be:

`DISCORD_TOKEN = "[OAuth Token]"`

Where [OAuth Token] is a discord botâ€™s OAuth token.

### Python Libraries

- discord.py

- python_dotenv

- pymongo

- yaml

### Config

On first launch a config file (`config.yaml`) will be created from `config.defaults`, this file contains all config options for paulBot aside from the oauth token.


*config.defaults*

```yaml
commandPrefix: "!"
imageFolder: "./Images"
imageSubfolders: 
  - Paul
defaultCat: Paul
databaseAddress: localhost
```
**defaultCat** = Default image subfolder to use if one isnt provided on command execution.

**databaseAddress** = ip of the mongoDB database being used for the bot.


### MongoDB Structure

The database should be named `paulDB` and have a collection called `users`, users needs to be initialized with a document with this structer:

```javascript
{
    "uuid":"totals",
    "totals":{}
}
```


## Additional Notes

A `debug-[date]-[time].log` file will be created on each startup of the bot in the `./Logs` directory. The date time format is `yearMonthDay-hourMinuteSecond`.
