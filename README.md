The bot requires a discord Oauth token which is stored in a file called `.env` in the program directory, this file is not included in this repo and must be setup for the bot to work. The contents of the file should be:

`DISCORD_TOKEN = "[OAuth Token]"`

Where [OAuth Token] is a discord botâ€™s OAuth token.
